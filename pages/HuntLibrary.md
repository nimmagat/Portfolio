# Hunt Library Usability Study

Role: Researcher, Morae Logger, Data analyst and Wireframe  

## Problem

The Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Daytona Beach (ERAU DB) library, Hunt Library, staff was looking to make changes to the website due to the school building a new library. They felt that the current website could use some improvement, so the asked a UX professor at ERAU to recommend some changes. This professor had our class run a study on both the desktop and mobile versions of the website. The goal was to find out what students liked and disliked about the website and what gave student the hardest time while using the website.

## Research Plan

The class created 20 tasks for the participants to complete. The tasks included various things that could be done on the website. The goal was to test a wide variety of the website’s capability. Once the tasks were selected the class tested each other to make sure that they made sense, tested what we wanted to test and were able to be completed on the website. Once the the tasks were set in stone our professor divided us into six groups. Three groups tested desktop and the other three tested mobile. Each group was in charge of four participants. The participants were instructed by a facilitator while the rest of the group watched and recorded date using morae. From there the class separated in to different teams to work on the presentation. The data was combined and reviewed. The data was used to create recommendations to improve the website.

## Participants

The participants were all students at Embry-Riddle. There was a total of 21 participants ranging in age from 17-30. The students all volunteered to participate in the study. 

## User Testing

Participants were instructed to complete the 20 tasks. Participants were given the tasks one at a time and the order of tasks was changed between participants. After each task, the participants were asked how difficult they felt the task was. While the participants were completing the tasks, the researchers that weren’t facilitating were watching and recording any important observations using morae. Once the participant was done, they were asked to fill out a survey about the Hunt library website. 

## Results 

The results for mobile showed that there was issues with accessing the navigation tabs that are located at the top of the website. The navigation menu is accessible though a menu button located in the top corner of the page on mobile. In general users felt the twitter feed and the rotating news and event feed looked like an advertisement, due to this no one paid attention to it. Next, participants had an issue when trying to figure out if the library had a book in stock. When they clicked the link that should lead them there, they were taken to a page that had a summary of the book. Of they scrolled to the bottom of the page it had the information they were looking for. Finally, when looking at the library calendar, it didn’t have the library hours listed. It also didn’t state if the library was closed on holidays.

Our class made a few recommendations regarding these issues. We recommended that they remove the twitter and rotating news feed from the home page. It could be replaced with a listed news and event feed and list the hours for the week. This would make it easier for students to locate the hours for the week and it would prevent them from feeling like there were advertisements on the website. We also made a recommendation to edit how the listing for available books show up, but due to a limitation of software this change isn’t possible for the library staff to complete. These recommendations were presented to the library staff along with our collected data, and is being used to help improve the library website.
