## Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Daytona Beach Website Usability Study

Role: Researcher and Data analyst 


# Problem

This project was an assignment for a class. We were tasked to pick a website that we felt could use improvement. The team decided to use the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Daytona Beach (ERAU DB) website. The website is mainly used by prospective students looking for information about the school or trying to apply. The goal was to test if the site was usable by new users.  


# Research Plan

The team created 9 tasks that tested the usability of the website. The focus was on the Daytona Beach website and every task was capable of being completed within the website. The participants, who were found using usertesting.com, were given the scenario of being a perspective student trying to figure out what the school had to offer. They were tasked to find out specified information that would show how someone would expect to navigate the website.


# Participants

The team gathered participants on usertesting.com. There were three participants, two males and one female, that ranged in age from 24-30. All three participants had never used the website before.


# User Testing

The participants were instructed to complete nine tasks and answer how difficult the task was on a scale of 1-5 and if they believed they have completed the tasks successfully. The participants were gathered using usertesting.com, so they did the tasks without the researchers there. They recorded themselves completing the task and the team watched and recorded the data after the fact. 


# Results 

The final results showed that the website was new user friendly. The participants that we had, had a few issues navigating the website and completing the tasks that the team assigned. An issue that was found showed that once a user opened the course catalog, pressing the logo that would normally return you to the homepage would take you to the catalog. From there it was easy to go to the wrong Embry-Riddle home page (they have four different websites). The veteran’s benefits were another issue that was found. It wasn’t clear where they could be found, and once found them there wasn’t much of a description.
